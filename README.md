- 1.0.0, 08/19/2021: Create the read-me portion of the application and push up the first commit

## About the Application

- I created this application as a way for card readers to play music, a blurb, or some type of response back when cards or phone tap event occurs. My inspiration for the application comes from shopping at trader Joes and when the transaction is complete a little tune is played at the end. 

## Problem Domain

- As a user I would like the tune or response to persist for a set amount of time after the card or phone tap event takes place. The solution is to set up a conditional event that will trigger the tune or response to play for a set interval.
